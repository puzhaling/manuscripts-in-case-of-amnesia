Routers are the building blocks of WANs. The largest WAN today is the Internet

TCP itself provides no record markers: If an application wants to delineate the 
ends of records, it must do so itself and there are a few common ways to accompl
ish this

Iterative server iterates through each client, one at a time. On the other side 
is a concurrent server

Raw sockets allows applications to bypass transport layer and use IPv4 and IPv6 
directly

Sockets provide the interface from the upper three layers of the OSI model into 
the transport layer

The sockets API originated with the 4.2BSD system, released in 1983

SCTP is similar to TCP as a reliable transport protocol, but it also provides me
ssage boundaries, transport-level support for multihoming, and a way to minimize
 head-of-line blocking

Although the protocol suite is called "TCP/IP", there are more members of this f
amily than just TCP and IP

ARP (Address Resolution protocol) maps an IPv4 address into a hardware address

A segment is the unit of data that TCP passes to IP

A TCP connection is full-duplex. This means that an application can send and rec
eive data in both directions on a given connection at any time

While it takes three segments to establish a connection, it takes four to termin
ate a connection

The MSL is the maximum amount of time that any given IP datagram can live in net
work

Unix systems have the concept of a reserved port, which is any port less than 10
24. These ports can only be assigned to a socket by an appropriately privileged 
process. All the IANA well-known ports are reserved ports

The socket pair for a TCP connection is the four-tuple that defines the two endp
oints of the connection: the local IP address, local post, foreign IP address, a
nd foreign port

The two values that identify each endpoint, an IP address and a port number, are
 often called a socket

The IPv4 DF bit and its implied IPv6 counterpart can be used for path MTU discov
ery

IPv4 and IPv6 define a minimum reassembly buffer size, the minimum datagram size
 that we are guaranteed any implementation must support

TCP must keep a copy of our data until it is acknowledged by the peer

The terms 'little-endian' and 'big-endian' indicate which end of the multibyte v
alue, the little end or the big end, is stored at the starting address of the va
