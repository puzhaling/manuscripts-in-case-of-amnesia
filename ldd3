User activities are performed by means of a set of standardized calls that are i
ndependent of the specific driver; mapping those calls to device specific operat
ions that act on real hardware is then the role of the device driver

When writing drivers, a programmer should pay particular attention to this funda
mental concept: write kernel code to access the hardware, but dont force particu
lar policies on the user, since different users have different needs
