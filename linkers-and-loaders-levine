Relocating loaders allowed the authors and users of the subprograms to write eac
h subprogram as though it would start at location zero, and to defer the actual 
address binding until the subprograms were linked with a particular main
program

With the advent of operating systems, relocating loaders separate from linkers a
nd libraries became necessary

Before OSs, each program had the machine's entire mempory at its disposal, so th
e program could be assembled and linked for fixed memory addresses, knowing that
 all addresses in the computer would be available. It defers final address bindi
ng past link time to load time. Linkers and loaders now divided up to work, with
 linkers doing part of the address binding, assigning relative addresses within 
each program, and the loader doing a final relocation step to assign actual addr
